        const article = { title: '1984 - The Ultimate Form of Totalitarianism', content: 'I just finished reading the dystopian novel "1984" and found that it\'s truly worth reading the original version. Other interpretations often compress or even distort the original content. For example, the English Socialist Party\'s most famous slogan in the novel isn\'t actually absurd. Instead, it describes the rational, albeit terrifying, logic of the Party and the other two countries in the world they\'ve created. Not reading the original can lead to misunderstandings of the book\'s intentions.\n\nSo, I won\'t interpret the plot. Instead, I\'ll discuss the real-world shadows of the society in the book and talk about issues related to totalitarian societies. This book shows us a terrifying scenario: the ultimate form of totalitarianism, a totalitarian civilization. This article may contain spoilers, so I suggest reading the original novel first. Without further ado, let\'s begin our discussion.\n\nPart One - The Party\'s Monopoly\n\nThroughout the book, the English Socialist Party (Ingsoc) leads the entire totalitarian government. In normal situations, especially in multi-party countries, even if one party controls some media, competing parties control other media. This allows people to get information that, while not completely true, can approach the truth through comprehensive coverage.\n\nBut in this totalitarian society, a single party holds absolute dominance, with no competing parties allowed to exist. In such a society, this party\'s control over information is almost absolute. All media and information are controlled by the Party. Under this totalitarianism, the Party controls the media, information, and facts.\n\nWith no other information sources, people can only believe the Party, and what people believe becomes what they consider the truth. So, the Party becomes what people consider the truth. It\'s precisely this perceived truth, rather than the actual truth, that influences people\'s judgments and the future direction of the world. This is the essence of Ingsoc\'s slogan: "Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past."\n\nHistory is just one aspect of all truths. The Party\'s control over truth goes far beyond this. As argued above, the Party controls not only the release of new information but can also control history. In the novel, Winston\'s job at the Ministry of Truth involves rewriting history for the Party. This happens when information the Party considers incorrect appears (such as the Party\'s wrong predictions about the future, previously falsified data that doesn\'t match current propaganda, or previous wars with other countries). All old materials are destroyed and replaced with new ones containing the "correct" information.\n\nIn such a society, people can\'t learn their true history from any historical materials, and they don\'t know that what they understand is incorrect because such arguments aren\'t allowed to exist. They have no other ways to access information, and unless the Party exercises self-discipline, the information they receive will always align with the Party\'s interests. This society has no freedom of the press or freedom to access information. In this society, people have no truth in their hearts, not even a glimpse of it.\n\nBecause people have no understanding of the real truth, their worldviews based on what they believe to be true are distorted. The Party deliberately creates and intensifies this to gain absolute control. In the book, for people who haven\'t yet fully become the ideal "new humans" under totalitarianism, they still need to find emotional outlets in their monotonous lives. But any other emotional outlets could potentially damage the Party\'s totalitarian rule. So, "Two Minutes Hate" and "Hate Week" appear, used to let people roar with anger at the current enemy.\n\nThe only emotional outlet in life becomes hatred for enemy countries. What\'s the benefit for the Party? This seemingly patriotic behavior actually diverts people\'s attention from real problems. Only in this way will people not blame the real cause of their reduced resources and worsening monotonous lives - the Party\'s leadership (rule). Instead, they\'re naturally guided towards hatred of enemy countries. In fact, this method is very successful. Orwell describes it like this: "The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in."\n\nFor these masses, they seem full of passion for the country, but this is only a primary patriotic sentiment. It\'s not based on any serious training or remembrance of the country\'s problems, but rather carefully planned and guided patriotism. This sentiment doesn\'t come from their understanding of the world situation, nor from their understanding of politics, and certainly not from their logical reasoning. All of this comes only from their complete ignorance of the facts.\n\nThis is "Ignorance is Strength," the third of the Party\'s slogans. It means that under the Party\'s propaganda, education, and nurturing, when the Party has become the truth of the world that the masses can understand, knowledge of the real truth is powerless. From another perspective, it means that fully believing the Party\'s words and the documents edited (tampered with) by the Party produces enormous power. The power of ignorance produced by ignorance of the truth is an irrational brute force, but it\'s enough to overwhelm sporadic pursuits of rational thinking and the results of rational thinking.\n\nThe result is that the whole society is filled with an optimistic atmosphere. However, this isn\'t optimism about universally recognized and pursued values, achieved through realizing these values. On the contrary, it\'s because they haven\'t achieved these values, but in the Party\'s propaganda, they\'ve achieved what the Party thinks people can pursue, such as material abundance and national strength. Although these don\'t exist in reality, for the ignorant masses and some Party members, this is the motivation that keeps them living and loving the Party.\n\nThe ignorance of the masses is the strength of the monopolistic totalitarian Party.\n\nPart Two - The Party and Other Countries\n\nIn the Party\'s narrative, it has a mission to liberate all of humanity. Of course, they don\'t really intend to give people freedom or democracy. Instead, they use this as a pretext to conquer humanity. The Party\'s anthem (in an extended work) includes the line: "to keep our great revolution alive," which refers to this idea. The method of liberation is through war, fighting over populous areas, and officially waging war against other countries.\n\nThe book doesn\'t describe the early stages of the revolution much. Even the most anti-government character in the book believes the revolution was betrayed. However, looking deeper, such socialist revolutions are unlikely to succeed in the long term unless the leaders have exceptional awareness. This is because socialist revolutions are based on an incorrect theory that only laborers create value, while capitalists don\'t. Modern mainstream economics has refuted this idea. Capitalists create value by taking on risks.\n\nRevolutions based on this theory can\'t last long because they inevitably lead to economic collapse. Other ideas will take over under the banner of socialism, seeking their own interests. These people often come from the previous revolutionary ranks. Socialist revolutions have leaders with enormous power but no long-term system to limit that power. Unlimited power leads to unlimited corruption. Therefore, socialist revolutions have no chance of success and only result in an uncontrollable totalitarian regime.\n\nWhy is a multi-party system better than a one-party system? You might say that different opinions can exist within a party. However, a single party becomes a micro-political structure, and its principles inevitably become uniform over time. Those in power within the party will eliminate dissent to expand their authority. As long as a party has leadership, it will become uniform. A multi-party system is a good constraint tool: it motivates the ruling party to maintain public support, allows people to choose different ideologies, and preserves social and information diversity, avoiding the dictatorship of a single party.\n\nAfter the initial liberation phase, a three-country balance of power emerges, and war becomes unique. In the world of 1984, there are three countries. Wars are fought over disputed territories between national borders. Since each country\'s power is balanced, wars involve two countries allying against the third.\n\nHowever, since no country wants to disrupt its own rule and aims to maintain the three-country balance, alliances are changeable and frequent, but not sincere. If the balance is broken, the remaining two countries can only become enemies. One side will eventually win due to random factors, causing the ruling groups and parties of the other country to lose their power and possibly their survival.\n\nSo, war becomes a pretext to divert conflicts and channel excess productivity. The war\'s target becomes unimportant. In fact, although the three countries claim to have different values, they are essentially the same, based on the same ruling logic of one-party dominance. In this situation, war is normal and brings direct peace for the ruling party. War only causes civilians to lose family members and some material rations. For the rulers, external war brings internal peace. This is how "War is Peace":\n\nThe "war" between countries provides reasons for poverty and other problems, giving the Party peace.\n\nPart Three - 1984 and China\n\nIn the real world, the country that most closely matches the description in 1984 is probably China (People\'s Republic of China).\n\nIn the novel, Oceania achieves absolute control through technological means, extrapolating the ultimate form of totalitarianism. In reality, China\'s control over information hasn\'t reached complete control, but such centralization of power does exist, just not as intensely. For example, China (the country where I live) has the Great Firewall. (Click to visit the Wikipedia page describing the Great Firewall)\n\nIn the People\'s Republic of China, the Great Firewall is a nationwide network project and the main means of controlling speech for the Chinese Communist Party, as the internet is the easiest way to spread information unfavorable to the Party. Like the ancient Great Wall, the internet firewall defends against the outside world. The difference is that one defends against foreign invasions, while the other blocks real information from the free world outside. This is unique worldwide. Chinese netizens (those who don\'t use VPNs or other means to bypass the Great Firewall) use what is essentially a local area network rather than the internet.\n\nThey can\'t access foreign websites blocked by the firewall in various ways. These sites contain diverse information, complex and filled with both junk and misinformation. But it\'s in this free flow of information that truth can be preserved. For example, the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989, the 2019 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement, and the 2022 White Paper Movement. These are the censored histories. The Chinese Communist Party uses its power to remove the truth from public view. This corresponds to "1984" in reality.\n\nBut in the world of 1984, because China hasn\'t reached that level yet and its technology isn\'t advanced enough to control people\'s minds, there are many cases of failed control. China\'s ruling party is, to some extent, no longer the same party that led the revolution. Modern China has entered an incomplete capitalist society under Deng Xiaoping\'s leadership. Of course, even this partial capitalism has given China many years of development. But after Xi Jinping came to power, he wants to regain the kind of power Mao had before.\n\nSo in China, the current party\'s goals and methods are similar to those during the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward periods, which align with the description in 1984. I won\'t elaborate on the Mao era in history, as many works vividly describe that period. I\'ll mainly talk about the weakened 1984-like scenario during the Xi era, a form of totalitarianism that\'s weaker than the description in 1984 but still strong in reality.\n\nLet\'s discuss this in relation to the three slogans of Ingsoc. First, "Freedom is Slavery" - the control and stigmatization of freedom. In China, real-name registration is implemented for mobile phones and platform backends. This system appears in the name of combating cybercrime but is actually used to control people\'s online speech. The Great Firewall, mentioned earlier, censors high-quality content on the domestic internet, accelerating the infantilization of the Chinese internet.\n\nOn the Chinese internet, the word "freedom" has almost become derogatory. Like the doublethink in 1984, China includes words like freedom and democracy in its core socialist values, making people believe the Party upholds these rights. But the masses criticize and insult those who advocate for democracy and freedom on the internet outside of Party propaganda, calling them Western capitalist running dogs.\n\nSecond, "War is Peace" - the fantasy of war against Taiwan. Taiwan, historically the government of the Republic of China that moved to the island, is not within China\'s actual territory. After failing to "liberate" Taiwan by force, China lost its right to represent China in the UN with Resolution 2758, but Taiwan still retained its original state. So the Taiwanese people want to separate from China to maintain their independence, democratic system, and statehood.\n\nAfter failing to get Taiwan, China began to promote the idea of taking Taiwan by force. On the internet, whenever the Taiwan issue is mentioned, netizens suddenly become excited as if injected with adrenaline, with curses, insults, and fantasies about Taiwan\'s return coming one after another. Interestingly, Chinese people don\'t understand Taiwan, and some don\'t even know that Taiwan is no longer a party-state ruled by the Kuomintang.\n\nThey don\'t even know that Taiwan\'s official name is the Republic of China, which the Taiwanese government was forced to keep under the pressure of war to prove that it is still China. In their education, the country founded by Sun Yat-sen after the Beiyang government is all called Chiang Kai-shek\'s dictatorship. The Chinese government wants this effect because this hatred towards a country they\'ve never understood can divert their attention from their own problems.\n\nOf course, China\'s uniqueness is that even countries that openly cooperate with the government can be seen as enemy states in people\'s minds. For example, the United States and Japan have helped China\'s economic development a lot, but netizens call them American imperialists and "little Japan". The Chinese people\'s hatred towards Japanese is unimaginable, but in reality, this is just a transfer of people\'s hatred towards their own government.\n\nFor instance, when the government concealed information about a forest fire, leading to its massive spread before being reported, people\'s focus wasn\'t on why the government hid the danger, but on Japanese spies. They claimed that Japan originally wanted to buy a kind of precious Chinese medicine, but when the deal fell through, they sent spies to burn down the growing base of this important medicine, which is why the forest fire suddenly became so large. Thus, scrutiny of government negligence turned into insults towards Japan, with one netizen saying, "It proves once again how bad Japan is."\n\nFinally, "Ignorance is Strength" - the government deliberately suppresses speech and science popularization, making themselves feel powerful. What\'s more terrifying about China compared to 1984 is that the Chinese masses have no hope, while those in 1984 do. The Chinese public (especially on the internet) surprisingly rejects universal values, considering them complete Westernization. They\'ve achieved internet activities similar to the Two Minutes Hate in 1984. For example, when Japan discharged nuclear wastewater, even though it was done after approval from the International Atomic Energy Agency and Chinese experts, the internet was flooded with insults towards Japan.\n\nThis situation continues to this day and has directly impacted China\'s own coastal seafood industry, with people frantically hoarding salt. For those bloggers who explain online that Japan\'s nuclear wastewater isn\'t actually very harmful, if they have a large following, they\'re directly deleted and banned by platforms actually controlled by the Party. Before and after that, a large group of netizens rush towards these voices like madmen, saying they\'re people sent by Japan to whitewash, bought off, without conscience. Little do they know, it\'s they who are (unwittingly) without conscience.\n\nHow did this situation come about? The Party controls everything, so everything should be under control, right? Why? Because of the education controlled by the Party. In Chinese schools, education has become a way to cultivate subservience in students. Students must obey all of the teacher\'s arrangements, and unless you get good grades, your disobedient behavior will be publicly criticized by the teacher.\n\nChinese schools are also the embryonic form of an unorganized atomic society and a platform for education. In schools, students are not supposed to do anything other than study and meet normal physiological needs like eating. They can\'t organize groups privately, can\'t talk about love (called premature love), can\'t talk back to teachers. In fact, in schools, teachers are like the authorities in society, controlling everything about the students, and students can\'t oppose them.\n\nThe good news is that China\'s totalitarianism is also collapsing. More and more people are "awakening" and learning the truth. More and more people are using various means to bypass the firewall to listen to the world\'s voices. China\'s economy has also started to decline, with GDP shrinking (in USD terms). All of this is a sign that this dynasty is about to collapse, but it\'s not enough.\n\nChina might still take the opportunity to militarize the country completely in the upcoming war against Taiwan, becoming North Korea 2.0. But the spark of hope still exists. And what we should do is to make it spread through our own actions.\n\nIn summary, 1984 outlines a terrifying future, depicting a chilling totalitarian society. It not only reflects the reality of its time but also serves as a warning for the future. To sum up, this novel tells us: Information monopoly is the foundation of totalitarian rule. When a party completely controls the dissemination of information and the writing of history, it can shape people\'s thoughts and reality.\n\nUnder totalitarian governments, ignorance is weaponized. By depriving people of their ability to access the truth, totalitarian governments can manipulate public opinion and divert conflicts. Perpetual war becomes a tool for maintaining stability. Hatred towards external enemies and a constant state of war become means of uniting people and suppressing dissent. The importance of pluralistic checks and balances. One-party dictatorship leads to corruption and abuse of power; only a multi-party system can ensure social diversity and power balance.\n\nWhat we need to do is prevent such a future from happening and organize to stop it from happening when possible. It might not be difficult. We can remain highly vigilant against any attempts to monopolize information or falsify history. Cultivate our critical thinking, don\'t blindly follow authority, and dare to question. Defend our basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press; they are barriers against totalitarianism. Educate the next generation about the dangers of totalitarianism and pass on the values of freedom and democracy. Raise objections when similar control measures are proposed for trial, and bravely refuse when asked to do things that can be done.\n\nThe future depicted in "1984" is not a distant one, but a mirror that constantly reminds us. Only when everyone realizes the preciousness of freedom and fights for it can we avoid sliding into the nightmare described by Orwell. As Winston wrote in his diary: "If there is hope, it lies in the proles." Hope lies in the awakening and action of every ordinary person. Let us work together to protect human dignity, defend freedom of thought, and contribute our efforts to create a more open, democratic, and diverse society.\n\nAfter all, who wants to live in a society like "1984"?', pinned: false };
