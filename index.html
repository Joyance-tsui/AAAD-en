        const article = { title: '1984 - The Ultimate Form of Totalitarianism', content: 'I just finished reading the dystopian novel 1984, and I found that it\'s really worth reading the original version. Other interpretations often simplify the content or even distort what the original text means. For example, the famous slogan of the Party in the book isn’t absurd; it reflects the rationality of the absurd world created by the Party and the other two countries at that time. Of course, it also shows a kind of terrifying rationality. So, not reading the original can lead to misunderstandings about the book\'s meaning.\n\nI won’t analyze the plot but will discuss the shadows of reality in the society portrayed in the book, as well as issues related to totalitarianism. This book shows us a frightening scenario, the ultimate form of totalitarianism, and a totalitarian civilization. This article may contain spoilers, so I recommend reading the original first. Let\'s get into today\'s discussion.\n\nPart One - The Party\'s Monopoly\n\nIn the book, the Party, known as the English Socialist Party, leads the entire totalitarian government. Normally, in a multi-party system, even if one party controls the media, competing parties can provide alternative information, allowing people to get closer to the truth.\n\nHowever, in a totalitarian society dominated by a single party with no competition, the Party has almost complete control over information. All media and information are controlled by the Party. In this situation, the Party controls the media, information, and even the facts.\n\nWithout other sources of information, people can only believe the Party, and their collective beliefs shape what they see as the truth. Therefore, the Party becomes the perceived truth. But this perceived truth, rather than the actual truth, affects people’s judgments and influences the future. This is reflected in the Party\'s slogan: "Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past."\n\nAmong all truths, history is just one part. The Party\'s control over the truth goes further. As mentioned, the Party doesn\'t just control new information; it also controls history. In the Ministry of Truth, where Winston works, the Party alters history. Whenever the Party finds incorrect information—like past errors in predictions or false data—it destroys old records and replaces them with new ones that reflect the current narrative.\n\nIn such a society, people cannot access accurate historical information and are unaware that what they know is incorrect, as such thoughts are not allowed. They have no other ways to get information, and unless the Party allows it, what they learn will always serve the Party\'s interests. There is no freedom of the press or access to information. In this society, people have no sense of truth, not even its surface.\n\nBecause people lack awareness of the real truth, their worldview is distorted. The Party intentionally amplifies this distortion to maintain absolute control. In the book, the ideal new human, still forming under totalitarian rule, seeks emotional outlets in a monotonous life. However, any emotional outlet could threaten the Party\'s power. Thus, the “Hate Week” and “Hate Sessions” are created to channel anger towards enemy nations.\n\nThis outlet becomes the hatred for foreign enemies. What is the Party’s benefit? This seemingly patriotic behavior diverts attention from real issues like resource shortages and poor living conditions, redirecting anger towards external enemies instead of the Party’s leadership. In fact, this method is very effective. Orwell describes the “Two Minutes Hate” as terrifying—not because you are forced to participate, but because avoiding it is impossible.\n\nThe masses appear passionate about their country, but this is a primitive form of patriotism—emotionally driven, untrained, and unaware of their nation\'s issues, yet carefully orchestrated. This emotion does not stem from an understanding of world politics or logical reasoning, but from ignorance of the facts.\n\nThis is the meaning of the Party\'s slogan, "Ignorance is Strength." Under the Party\'s propaganda and education, the Party becomes the only source of truth for the people. Believing entirely in the Party\'s edited narratives creates immense power. This power from ignorance overshadows any pursuit of rational thought.\n\nAs a result, the entire society is filled with a false sense of optimism—not based on shared values, but on the belief that they have achieved what the Party claims is desirable, such as wealth and national strength. Although these do not exist in reality, for the ignorant masses and some Party members, this belief is enough to sustain their lives and loyalty to the Party.\n\nThe ignorance of the masses is the strength of the monopolistic totalitarian Party.\n\nPart Two - The Party and Other Nations\n\nIn the Party’s narrative, its mission is to liberate all humanity. However, they do not genuinely seek to provide freedom or democracy; instead, they use this pretext to conquer. Their national anthem states, “to keep our great revolution alive,” highlighting this aim. The method of liberation is through war, targeting populous regions and engaging in conflicts with other nations.\n\nThe book offers little description of the early revolutionary period, even among those who oppose the regime. Their view is that the revolution has been betrayed. On a deeper level, a socialist revolution can only succeed if led by highly aware leaders; otherwise, it is unlikely to last. This is because socialist theory incorrectly claims that only labor creates value, while capitalists do not. Modern economics has refuted this idea, showing that capitalists create value by taking risks.\n\nA revolution based on such flawed theory cannot endure, leading to economic collapse. Other ideologies may then adopt the label of socialism to pursue their own interests, often emerging from the original revolutionary ranks. Socialist revolutions are led by individuals with immense power, but without long-term institutional checks on that power. This unchecked authority leads to corruption, making the success of a socialist revolution impossible, resulting instead in an uncontrollable totalitarian regime.\n\nWhy is a multiparty system better than a single-party system? One might argue that different opinions can exist within a party, but a single party functions as a miniature political structure that inevitably becomes more homogenized over time. As a result, those in power will eliminate dissent to expand their authority. Whenever a party has a leader, uniformity will follow. In contrast, a multiparty system serves as a valuable constraint: it motivates the ruling party to maintain public support, allows citizens to choose among different ideologies, and preserves social and informational diversity, preventing dictatorship.\n\nAfter the initial phase of liberation, a balance of power among three nations emerges, making war unique. This war does not aim to occupy land in the traditional sense. In the world of *1984*, there are three countries. Wars are fought over disputed territories, or borderlands. Since the strength of each country is relatively equal, conflicts occur through alliances between one country and another to attack a third.\n\nEach nation wishes to maintain its rule and the balance of power, making alliances fluid and insincere. If the balance is broken, the remaining two countries will become enemies. Eventually, one side will win due to random factors, leading to the loss of power, or even existence, for the other country’s ruling party.\n\nThus, war serves as a facade, a means to redirect tensions and surplus production. The specific targets of war become unimportant. Although all three nations claim to have different values, they are essentially the same, based on a common logic of domination—one-party rule. In this context, war becomes the norm, providing direct peace for the ruling party. Such wars may cost civilians their families and disrupt resource distribution, but for the rulers, external conflicts ensure internal peace. This is the meaning of "war is peace."\n\nWar between nations provides justification for poverty and other issues, allowing the Party to maintain peace.\n\nPart Three - 1984 and China\n\nIn the real world, China (People\'s Republic of China) closely resembles the world described in *1984*.\n\nIn the novel, Oceania uses technology for total control, showing us the ultimate form of totalitarianism. In reality, China’s control over information is extreme but not absolute. However, there is still a form of authoritarianism present, though not as intense. For example, the Great Firewall of China (click to visit the Wikipedia page on the Great Firewall).\n\nIn the People\'s Republic of China, the Great Firewall is a nationwide internet project and a main tool for the Communist Party’s control of speech. The internet is the easiest way for unfavorable information about the Party to spread. Like the ancient Great Wall, the Great Firewall keeps out the outside world. The difference is that one prevents foreign invasion, while the other blocks true information from the free world. This is unique to the world. Internet users in China (those who don’t use VPNs to bypass the firewall) only access a limited local network, not the real internet.\n\nThey cannot view foreign websites that are blocked by the firewall, which contain complex information, filled with both junk and misleading content. But it is this free information that allows the truth to survive, like the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989, the anti-extradition protests in 2019, and the white paper movement in 2022. This is the history that has been erased. The Communist Party uses its power to remove the truth from the public view. This mirrors *1984* in real life.\n\nHowever, the world of *1984* has not fully taken shape in China, as its technology is not yet advanced enough to control people’s minds completely. Thus, many failures of control occur. The ruling party in China is not the same as the revolutionary party of the past. Under Deng Xiaoping, China entered an incomplete capitalist society, which has led to years of development. But since Xi Jinping came to power, he seeks to regain the kind of power Mao had.\n\nToday, the goals and methods of the Party are similar to those during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, aligning with *1984*. I will focus on the weakened *1984*-like situation under Xi’s rule, which is less intense than the novel\'s depiction but still represents a form of totalitarianism.\n\nLet’s explore this by comparing it to three slogans from the English-speaking world. First, "Freedom is Slavery," which reflects control and stigmatization of freedom. In China, there is a real-name system for mobile phone numbers and platforms. This system, under the guise of fighting online crime, is used to control what people say online. The Great Firewall also leads to censorship of high-quality content, resulting in a less mature internet.\n\nOn the Chinese internet, the word "freedom" has become almost derogatory. Just like in *1984*, China writes "freedom" and "democracy" into its core values, leading people to believe the Party protects these rights. Yet, the public criticizes and insults those who advocate for democracy and freedom, calling them Western capitalist lackeys.\n\nNext, "War is Peace," reflects the imagined war with Taiwan. Historically, Taiwan, governed by the Republic of China, is not part of China’s actual territory. After a failed attempt to reclaim Taiwan by force, it lost its UN representation but retains its status as a nation. The people of Taiwan seek independence to preserve their democratic system.\n\nAfter failing to gain Taiwan, China increasingly advocates for military action. When Taiwan is mentioned online, netizens react with anger, using insults and fantasies about Taiwan’s return. Interestingly, many Chinese people know little about Taiwan, with some unaware that it is no longer governed by the Kuomintang.\n\nThey may not even know Taiwan\'s official name is the Republic of China. This name is kept under pressure from war, to assert its claim to being China. In education, Sun Yat-sen’s government is often depicted as a dictatorship under Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese government benefits from this hatred toward a country they hardly understand, deflecting attention from their own issues.\n\nMoreover, even countries that collaborate with China, like the U.S. and Japan, can be seen as enemies by the public. While they significantly helped China\'s economic growth, netizens label them as imperialists. The hatred for Japanese people is intense, but it often reflects the public’s discontent with their own government.\n\nFor instance, when the government downplayed a massive wildfire, public focus shifted from the government\'s failure to blame Japanese spies. They claimed Japan wanted to buy valuable Chinese medicine and sent spies to burn its growth area, leading to the wildfire. This redirected anger toward Japan rather than the government’s negligence.\n\nLastly, "Ignorance is Strength" reflects the government’s deliberate suppression of speech and knowledge. This creates a powerless public. The situation in China is even more frightening than in *1984*, as the public lacks hope. Many Chinese people, especially online, reject universal values, viewing them as total Westernization. Their online behavior mirrors the hatred seen among Party members in *1984*. For example, when Japan discharged nuclear wastewater, despite international approval, the internet was flooded with insults toward Japan.\n\nThis reaction continues to affect China’s coastal seafood industry, leading to a salt panic. Those who tried to educate the public about the real dangers of Japan\'s nuclear waste faced censorship and bans from platforms controlled by the Party. Many netizens accused them of being paid agents defending Japan, unaware that their own behavior is misguided.\n\nHow did this happen? The Party controls everything, so everything should fall under its control, thanks to its educational system. In Chinese schools, education fosters obedience. Students must follow teachers’ orders; only good performance earns them some freedom from criticism.\n\nChinese schools resemble a disorganized microcosm of society, where students cannot form groups or discuss relationships. Teachers act like the ruling class, having complete control over students, who cannot oppose them.\n\nHowever, there is a sign of change: China\'s totalitarianism is crumbling. More people are "waking up" and discovering the truth. Increasingly, people are using various methods to bypass the Great Firewall and listen to the world. China\'s economy is also declining, with GDP shrinking (in USD terms). These are signs that this regime is nearing collapse, but it’s not enough yet.\n\nChina might militarize further during a potential war with Taiwan, fully becoming a North Korea-like state. Yet, hope still exists. We should act to fan the flames of hope.\n\nIn summary, *1984* depicts a terrifying future, illustrating a chilling totalitarian society. It reflects the reality of its time and serves as a warning for the future. The novel tells us that information monopoly is the foundation of totalitarian rule. When a party controls information and history, it can shape people’s thoughts and reality.\n\nUnder a totalitarian government, ignorance is weaponized. By depriving people of the truth, the regime can manipulate public opinion and divert attention. Eternal war becomes a tool for stability, with hatred for external enemies uniting people and suppressing dissent. The importance of checks and balances is clear. One-party rule leads to corruption; only a multi-party system can ensure diversity and power balance.\n\nOur task is to prevent such a future and organize against it when possible. This might not be hard. We must remain vigilant against any attempt to monopolize information or distort history. We should cultivate critical thinking, question authority, and defend our rights to free speech and press. Educating the next generation about the dangers of totalitarianism and passing on the values of freedom and democracy is crucial. When similar control measures arise, we must speak out and bravely refuse compliance.\n\n*1984* is not a distant future but a mirror warning us. Only when everyone recognizes the value of freedom and fights for it can we avoid slipping into Orwell’s nightmare. As Winston wrote in his diary, "If there is hope, it lies in the proles." Hope rests in the awakening and actions of ordinary people. Let us work together to uphold human dignity, defend freedom of thought, and contribute to a more open, democratic, and diverse society.\n\nAfter all, who wants to live in a society like 1984?', pinned: false };
